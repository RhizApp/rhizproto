## Strategic Direction Shift

### Before This Planning

**Approach:** Implement attestation system as enhancement to existing Rhiz

**Focus:** Feature addition

**Timeline:** 8 weeks to attestation launch

---

### After This Planning

**Approach:** Position Rhiz as protocol standard, not just AT Protocol app

**Focus:** Protocol specification + reference implementation

**Timeline:**
- **Q4 2025:** Protocol spec + attestation system
- **Year 1-3:** Build best relationship protocol on AT Protocol
- **Future:** Multi-chain only when strategically valuable

**Key Insight:** Build protocol depth before blockchain breadth

---

## Key Decisions Documented

### 1. Protocol-First Approach
Rhiz is a protocol specification that happens to have an AT Protocol implementation, not an AT Protocol app that might go multi-chain.

### 2. Relationships as Core Focus
Every feature evaluated against: "Does this make relationships more useful?"

### 3. AT Protocol Deep
Leverage AT Protocol's strengths (user ownership, federation) before considering other chains.

### 4. Multi-Chain Deferred
Only consider multi-chain when:
- 10K+ monthly users on AT Protocol
- Proven demand from users
- Technical limitations we can't solve
- Team grown to 5+ people
- Funding secured

### 5. Small Team Realistic
Plans scoped for 1-3 person team with clear priorities and outsourcing strategy.
