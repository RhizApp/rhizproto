# Rhiz Protocol Specification v1.0

**The Relationship Protocol for the Internet**

---

## Abstract

Rhiz Protocol is a decentralized protocol for creating, verifying, and querying machine-readable relationships between entities. Built natively on AT Protocol, Rhiz enables cryptographically verifiable, user-owned relationship data with trust scoring and network attestation.

**Core Innovation:** Relationships are first-class data structures with quantified trust, temporal dynamics, and network verification - not just social graph edges.

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Social networks today model connections as binary (follow/unfollow) or implicit (likes, comments). This fails to capture:

- **Relationship strength** - How well do two people know each other?
- **Relationship context** - Why are they connected?
- **Relationship verification** - Can others attest to this connection?
- **Trust dynamics** - How has trust evolved over time?

Rhiz Protocol solves this by making relationships **quantified, contextual, and verifiable**.

### 1.2 Design Principles

1. **User Ownership** - Relationship data lives in user repositories, not centralized databases
2. **Cryptographic Verification** - All relationships require signatures from both parties
3. **Network Attestation** - Third parties can verify and attest to relationships
4. **Trust Quantification** - Transparent algorithms calculate trust scores
5. **Temporal Awareness** - Relationships evolve over time
6. **Federation-Ready** - Multiple services can index the same data
7. **Privacy-First** - Granular control over relationship visibility

### 1.3 Use Cases

- **Warm Introductions** - Find trusted paths between people
- **Professional Networking** - Verified relationships with context
- **Trust-Weighted Graphs** - Pathfinding algorithms using trust scores
- **Reputation Systems** - Network-verified identity and credentials
- **Community Mapping** - Visualize relationship networks

## 2. Core Primitives

### 2.1 Entity

An **Entity** is any person, organization, or agent in the protocol.

**Identifier:** AT Protocol DID (e.g., `did:plc:abc123xyz`)

**Properties:**
- `did` (string, required) - Decentralized identifier
- `name` (string, required) - Display name
- `type` (enum, required) - `person | organization | agent`
- `handle` (string, optional) - Human-readable handle (e.g., `alice.bsky.social`)
- `attributes` (object, optional) - Extensible metadata

**Storage:** `at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.entity.profile/self`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "$type": "net.rhiz.entity.profile",

### 2.2 Relationship

A **Relationship** represents a connection between two or more entities with quantified trust and context.

### 2.3 Attestation

An **Attestation** is a third-party validation of a relationship or claim.

- Example: `at://did:plc:carol/net.rhiz.relationship.attestation/3jx8abc`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "$type": "net.rhiz.relationship.attestation",
  "targetRelationship": "at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/3jx7ytm",
  "attester": "did:plc:carol",

  "createdAt": "2025-10-22T11:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2.4 Trust Metrics

**Trust metrics** quantify the reliability and strength of relationships and entities.

**Entity-Level Metrics:**
- `trustScore` (0-100) - Overall trustworthiness of the entity
- `reputation` (0-100) - Network consensus on reliability
- `reciprocity` (0-100) - Mutual relationship strength
- `consistency` (0-100) - Stability over time
- `relationshipCount` - Total number of relationships
- `verifiedRelationshipCount` - Relationships with attestations

**Relationship-Level Metrics:**
- `strength` (0-100) - Self-reported relationship strength
- `convictionScore` (0-100) - Network confidence in relationship
- `attestationCount` - Number of third-party attestations
- `verifyCount` - Number of verify attestations
- `disputeCount` - Number of dispute attestations

**Storage:** Trust metrics can be cached in `at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.trust.metrics/{tid}`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "$type": "net.rhiz.trust.metrics",
  "subject": "did:plc:alice",
  "trustScore": 88,
  "reputation": 91,
  "reciprocity": 85,
  "consistency": 89,

## 3. Protocol Operations

### 3.1 Creating a Relationship

**Process:**
1. Entity A initiates relationship creation
2. Relationship record created in Entity A's repository
3. Entity B signs the relationship (mutual consent)
4. Relationship becomes active and discoverable
5. Firehose broadcasts the relationship to indexers

**Cryptographic Requirements:**
- Both parties must sign the relationship record
- Signatures use keys from DID documents
- Verification checks both signatures are valid

**AT Protocol Flow:**
```
1. Alice creates relationship record in her repo
   at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/3jx7ytm

2. Bob retrieves the record, signs it, and stores signature

3. Both signatures attached to the record

4. Firehose broadcasts commit to indexers

5. Indexers verify signatures and index relationship
```

---

### 3.2 Attesting to a Relationship

**Process:**
1. Attester discovers a relationship (via graph query or direct link)
2. Attester evaluates the relationship
3. Attester creates attestation record in their repository
4. Attestation references target relationship by AT URI
5. Indexers recalculate conviction score for the relationship

**Requirements:**
- Attester must have a Rhiz entity profile
- Attester's reputation affects attestation weight
- Attestation is cryptographically signed

**AT Protocol Flow:**
```
1. Carol finds Alice-Bob relationship
   at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/3jx7ytm

2. Carol creates attestation in her repo
   at://did:plc:carol/net.rhiz.relationship.attestation/3jx8abc

3. Firehose broadcasts Carol's attestation

4. Indexer picks up attestation, recalculates conviction

5. Relationship conviction score updates: 0 â†’ 72
```

---

### 3.3 Calculating Conviction Scores

**Conviction Algorithm:**

```
For each attestation:
  1. Get base weight by type:
     - verify: +1.0
     - dispute: -1.5 (weighted higher for fraud prevention)
     - strengthen: +0.5
     - weaken: -0.5

  2. Apply reputation multiplier (0.5x to 2.0x):
     multiplier = 0.5 + (attester_reputation / 100) * 1.5

  3. Apply temporal decay (180-day half-life):
     decay = 0.5 ^ (days_old / 180)

  4. Scale by confidence (0-100):
     weight = base_weight * reputation * decay * (confidence / 100)

Aggregate:
  weighted_sum = sum of all weights
  total_weight = sum of absolute weights

  conviction = 50 + (weighted_sum / total_weight) * 50
  conviction = clamp(conviction, 0, 100)
```

**Result:** Integer score from 0 (low confidence) to 100 (high confidence)

**Properties:**
- High-reputation attesters have more impact
- Disputes weighted 1.5x to penalize fraud
- Old attestations decay over time
- Multiple attestations aggregate

---

### 3.4 Graph Queries

**Find Path Between Entities:**

Query: `net.rhiz.graph.findPath`

```typescript
{
  from: "did:plc:founder",
  to: "did:plc:investor",
  maxHops: 6,
  minStrength: 50
}
```

Response: Array of paths with trust-weighted scores

```typescript
{
  paths: [
    {
      hops: [
        { entity: "did:plc:founder", relationship: "at://..." },
        { entity: "did:plc:cofounder", relationship: "at://..." },
        { entity: "did:plc:investor", relationship: "at://..." }
      ],
      totalStrength: 66,
      hopCount: 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Get Neighbors:**

Query: `net.rhiz.graph.getNeighbors`

```typescript
{
  did: "did:plc:alice",
  minStrength: 60,
  limit: 50
}
```

Response: Array of connected entities with relationship details
