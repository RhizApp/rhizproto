# Start Here: Rhiz Protocol Documentation Index

**Welcome to Rhiz Protocol!** This guide helps you navigate the documentation.

## What is Rhiz Protocol?

Rhiz Protocol is **the relationship protocol for the internet** - a specification for machine-readable, verifiable relationships with quantified trust.

**Think of it like:**
- OAuth for relationships
- W3C DID for connections
- A protocol standard, not a single platform

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Choose Your Path

### I want to understand the protocol

**Read:** [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md)

This is the formal specification defining:
- Core primitives (Entity, Relationship, Attestation, Trust)
- Data structures (chain-agnostic)
- Cryptographic requirements
- Trust algorithms
- Protocol operations

**Time:** 45 minutes
**Outcome:** You understand what Rhiz Protocol defines

---

### I want to implement Rhiz

**Read:** [AT_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](AT_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

This documents our reference implementation on AT Protocol:
- Architecture patterns
- Lexicon schema design decisions
- Repository operations
- Firehose indexing
- Trust calculation implementation
- Performance optimizations
- Lessons learned

**Time:** 1 hour
**Outcome:** You know how to implement Rhiz on any tech stack

---

### I want to build on Rhiz

**Read:** [Project Overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) then [Quick Start](#quick-start)

This explains the system architecture and gets you coding:
- What's built already
- How to run locally
- SDK usage examples
- API endpoints
- Common patterns

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Outcome:** You're building an application using Rhiz

---

### I want to know the roadmap

**Read:** [RHIZ_PROTOCOL_ROADMAP.md](RHIZ_PROTOCOL_ROADMAP.md)

This shows our 3-year plan:
- Year 1: Foundation + Attestation system
- Year 2: Scale + Ecosystem growth
- Year 3: Maturity + Sustainability
- Next 90 days (detailed)

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Outcome:** You know where we're going

## Key Concepts

### Entity
Any person, organization, or agent. Identified by a DID.

```json
{
  "did": "did:plc:abc123",
  "name": "Alice Chen",
  "type": "person"
}
```

### Relationship
Quantified connection between entities with context and signatures.

```json
{
  "participants": ["did:plc:alice", "did:plc:bob"],
  "type": "professional",
  "strength": 85,
  "context": "Co-founded TechCo",
  "signatures": [...]
}
```

### Attestation
Third-party validation of a relationship.

```json
{
  "targetRelationship": "at://...",
  "attester": "did:plc:carol",
  "attestationType": "verify",
  "confidence": 90,
  "evidence": "I worked with both"
}
```

### Trust Metrics
Calculated scores based on network consensus.

```json
{
  "trustScore": 88,      // Overall trust (0-100)
  "reputation": 91,      // Network consensus
  "reciprocity": 85,     // Mutual relationships
  "consistency": 89      // Stable over time
}
```

### Conviction Score
Network confidence in a relationship (0-100), based on attestations.

```json
{
  "score": 87,
  "attestationCount": 15,
  "verifyCount": 14,
  "disputeCount": 1,
  "trend": "increasing"
}
```

## Architecture

### High-Level Flow

```
User AT Protocol Repo (Source of Truth)
  â†“ commits via
AT Protocol Firehose (Real-time sync)
  â†“ subscribed by
Rhiz Indexer (Process & validate)
  â†“ stores in
PostgreSQL Database (Fast queries)
  â†“ served by
Rhiz API (XRPC endpoints)
  â†“ consumed by
Applications (FundRhiz, etc.)
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **DIDs as Primary Keys**
   - Not UUIDs or arbitrary IDs
   - Cryptographically verifiable
   - Cross-platform compatible

2. **Integer Scores (0-100)**
   - Not floats
   - AT Protocol compatible
   - Better UX

3. **Dual Signatures**
   - Both participants must sign
   - Prevents fake relationships
   - Cryptographic proof

4. **Firehose Indexing**
   - Real-time updates
   - AT Protocol standard
   - Scales well

5. **User-Owned Data**
   - Records in user repos
   - Not centralized database
   - Portable across services

## FAQ

### Is Rhiz Protocol blockchain-specific?

No. The protocol specification is chain-agnostic. Our reference implementation uses AT Protocol, but the primitives (Entity, Relationship, Attestation, Trust) can be implemented on any tech stack.

### Can I use Rhiz without AT Protocol?

Yes. You can implement Rhiz on NEAR, Ethereum, or any other chain. Follow the [PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md](PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md) and adapt storage/identity layers.

### Is there a token?

Not yet. Phase 1-2 focus on proving the protocol works without economic incentives. A token might be introduced in Year 3 (2027-2028) if organic adoption validates the need.

### How do I integrate Rhiz into my app?

Install the SDK (`pnpm add @atproto/rhiz-sdk`), initialize a client, and use the relationship APIs. See [Quick Start](#quick-start) above.

### Can I run my own Rhiz AppView?

Yes! The reference implementation is open-source. Run the firehose indexer and API server to operate your own AppView. Multiple AppViews can index the same user data (federation).

### What about privacy?

Relationships have granular privacy controls:
- `public` - Discoverable by anyone
- `connections` - Only visible to connected entities
- `private` - Only visible to participants

Users control visibility for each relationship.

### How accurate are trust scores?

Current target: 85%+ correlation with manual validation. Trust algorithms are transparent and reproducible. Attestations improve accuracy through network consensus.
