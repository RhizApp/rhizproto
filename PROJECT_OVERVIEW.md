# Rhiz Protocol - Project Overview

## 🌐 The Relationship Layer of the Internet

Rhiz Protocol is the first **truly AT Protocol-native relationship intelligence system**, providing the missing infrastructure layer for trust-weighted social graphs, warm introductions, and multi-agent coordination across decentralized networks.

---

## What Makes Rhiz Different

### AT Protocol Native, Not AT Protocol Adjacent

**Most projects use AT Protocol peripherally** - they might store some data in repos or use DIDs optionally. **Rhiz IS AT Protocol native from the ground up:**

✅ **DIDs as Primary Identifiers** - Every entity is a DID, not an arbitrary ID
✅ **Records in User Repos** - Relationships stored as `at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/{tid}`
✅ **Content-Addressed** - All records referenced by AT URI + CID
✅ **Firehose Indexed** - Real-time AppView pattern for federation
✅ **Cryptographically Signed** - All relationships require participant signatures
✅ **User-Owned Data** - Records live in user's repo, portable across services

This isn't incremental - it's **architectural excellence**.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Relationships Are Invisible Infrastructure

Social networks show you **connections** (follows, likes), but they don't understand **relationships** (trust, context, strength, verification). This creates:

- **Discovery Friction** - Hard to find the right person for introductions
- **Trust Ambiguity** - No machine-readable trust between entities
- **Walled Gardens** - Relationship data locked in silos
- **Cold Introductions** - No warm path-finding through trusted networks
- **Zero Portability** - Can't take your relationship graph when you leave

### Rhiz Makes Relationships Machine-Readable

```typescript
// Before: Relationships are implicit, unmeasured, siloed
Alice follows Bob (boolean)

// After: Relationships are explicit, quantified, portable
at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/3jx7ytmdwej2k
{
  participants: ['did:plc:alice', 'did:plc:bob'],
  type: 'professional',
  strength: 85,  // 0-100 scale
  context: 'Co-founded TechCo, worked together 3 years',
  verification: {
    consensusScore: 92,
    verifierCount: 7,
    confidence: 95
  },
  signatures: [/* cryptographic proofs from both */]
}
```

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Trust-Weighted Graph Analytics

Find the **strongest path** between any two entities:

```typescript
const paths = await client.graph.findPath({
  from: 'did:plc:founder',
  to: 'did:plc:investor',
  maxHops: 6,
  minStrength: 50  // Only paths with 50+ strength
});

// Returns:
// Path 1: Founder → Co-founder (85) → Investor (78) = 66 total strength
// Path 2: Founder → Advisor (90) → VC Partner (72) → Investor (95) = 62
```

**Why this matters:** The first truly **trust-weighted** pathfinding for social graphs.

### 2. Warm Introduction Automation

AI agents facilitate introductions through **optimal intermediaries**:

```typescript
const intro = await client.intro.requestIntroduction({
  requester: 'did:plc:founder',
  target: 'did:plc:investor',
  context: 'Seeking Series A investment',
  message: 'Building AI-powered social network...'
});

// Rhiz finds best path, agent reaches out to intermediary:
// "Alice, you know both Bob (the founder) and Carol (the investor).
//  Would you facilitate an introduction?"
```

**Why this matters:** Automates the **most valuable** but **most manual** part of networking.

### 3. Quantified Trust Metrics

Transparent, verifiable trust scores:

```typescript
const metrics = await client.trust.getMetrics('did:plc:alice');

// Returns:
{
  trustScore: 88,        // Overall trust (0-100)
  reputation: 91,        // Network consensus
  reciprocity: 85,       // Mutual relationships
  consistency: 89,       // Stable over time
  relationshipCount: 47,
  verifiedRelationshipCount: 42
}
```

**Why this matters:** First system to make **trust machine-readable and verifiable**.

### 4. Federation & Data Portability

Multiple services can index the same relationship data:

```
User's AT Protocol Repo (Source of Truth)
         ↓ Firehose
    ┌────┴────┬────────┐
    ▼         ▼        ▼
AppView 1  AppView 2  AppView 3
Service A  Service B  Service C
```

**Why this matters:** Users **own** their relationship data. Services **compete** on features, not lock-in.

### 5. Cryptographic Verification

All relationships are cryptographically signed by both participants:

```typescript
// Both Alice and Bob must sign the relationship
signatures: [
  { did: 'did:plc:alice', signature: 'base64...' },
  { did: 'did:plc:bob', signature: 'base64...' }
]

// Anyone can verify signatures using public keys from DID documents
const isValid = await verifyRelationship(record);
```

**Why this matters:** **Impossible to fake** relationships - they're cryptographically provable.

## Flagship Application: FundRhiz

**FundRhiz** is the first application built on Rhiz Protocol, automating warm introductions between founders and investors.

### Problem

- Founders need intros to investors but lack direct connections
- Cold emails have <1% response rate
- Warm intros have >40% success rate
- Finding the right intermediary is manual and time-consuming

### Solution

1. **Smart Pathfinding** - Discovers optimal intro routes through your network
2. **Founder Agent** - AI-powered pitch preparation and delivery
3. **Investor Agent** - Automated evaluation and scoring
4. **Trust-Based Routing** - Uses verified relationships for highest quality paths
5. **Context Matching** - Finds investors with relevant expertise/interests

### Example Flow

```
1. Founder: "I need an intro to Sequoia Capital"
2. Rhiz finds path: Founder → Co-founder → Former colleague → VC Partner
3. Trust scores: 85 → 78 → 92 (total: 61)
4. Founder agent crafts pitch
5. Intermediary agents facilitate handoffs
6. Investor agent evaluates and responds
7. Introduction complete with full context
```

## Protocol Specification

### Lexicon Schemas (11 files)

All schemas in `lexicons/net/rhiz/`:

**Entity Schemas:**
- `entity/profile.json` - Entity profile record (key: literal:self)
- `entity/defs.json` - Entity type definitions

**Relationship Schemas:**
- `relationship/record.json` - Relationship record (key: tid)
- `relationship/defs.json` - Relationship types, verification, privacy, temporal

**Trust Schemas:**
- `trust/metrics.json` - Trust metrics record (key: tid)
- `trust/defs.json` - Trust score definitions

**Introduction Schemas:**
- `intro/request.json` - Introduction request record (key: tid)
- `intro/defs.json` - Intro status and agent intent

**Graph Schemas:**
- `graph/findPath.json` - XRPC query for pathfinding
- `graph/getNeighbors.json` - XRPC query for neighbors
- `graph/defs.json` - Graph hop and path definitions

### Record Types

All Rhiz records follow AT Protocol patterns:

```
at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.entity.profile/self
at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/{tid}
at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.trust.metrics/{tid}
at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.intro.request/{tid}
```

### XRPC Queries

```
POST /xrpc/net.rhiz.graph.findPath
  Input: { from: DID, to: DID, maxHops, minStrength }
  Output: { paths: [{ hops, totalStrength, distance }] }

GET /xrpc/net.rhiz.graph.getNeighbors
  Input: { did: DID, minStrength, limit, cursor }
  Output: { neighbors: [{ entity, relationshipUri, strength }] }
```

---

## Key Innovations

### 1. Integer-Scaled Trust Scores (0-100)

Instead of floats (0.0-1.0), we use integers (0-100):
- **More precise** - 100 discrete values vs float precision
- **AT Protocol compliant** - Lexicon doesn't support floats
- **Better UX** - "85% trust" is clearer than "0.85 trust"
- **Avoids float issues** - No comparison or rounding problems

### 2. Dual-Signature Relationships

Every relationship requires signatures from **both** participants:
- **Prevents faking** - Can't claim relationship without counterparty consent
- **Cryptographic proof** - Verifiable using DID document keys
- **Mutual verification** - Both parties attest to the relationship
- **Audit trail** - Signatures stored permanently in record

### 3. AppView Pattern for Relationships

Following AT Protocol's federated architecture:
- **Source of truth**: User repos (decentralized)
- **Query layer**: PostgreSQL indexes (optimized)
- **Real-time sync**: Firehose subscription (eventual consistency)
- **Federation**: Multiple AppViews can serve same data

### 4. Temporal Relationship Dynamics

Relationships evolve over time:
```typescript
temporal: {
  start: '2020-01-15T00:00:00Z',
  lastInteraction: '2025-10-20T14:30:00Z',
  history: [
    { timestamp: '2020-01-15', strength: 70, event: 'Started collaboration' },
    { timestamp: '2021-06-01', strength: 80, event: 'Product launch' },
    { timestamp: '2023-03-15', strength: 85, event: 'Series A raised' }
  ]
}
```

Enables: Trust velocity, momentum detection, decay modeling, seasonality.

---

## Why Now

### The Timing is Perfect

1. **AT Protocol is production-ready** - Bluesky has proven federation works
2. **AI agents are mature** - GPT-4 enables sophisticated coordination
3. **Privacy concerns are mainstream** - Users want data ownership
4. **Social graphs are broken** - Walled gardens limit innovation
5. **Relationships matter** - Post-pandemic emphasis on connection quality

### The Market is Ready

- **Bluesky** - 10M+ users on AT Protocol
- **Decentralized social** - Growing movement away from centralized platforms
- **AI agents** - Businesses adopting agent workflows
- **Trust infrastructure** - Missing primitive for decentralized systems

---

## Competitive Advantage

### What Others Are Doing

- **LinkedIn** - Proprietary relationship graph, no portability
- **Graph databases** - Generic, not relationship-specific
- **Social networks** - Connections, not relationships
- **Trust platforms** - Centralized, not cryptographically verifiable

### What Rhiz Does Differently

✅ **AT Protocol native** - Federation and portability built-in
✅ **Cryptographic verification** - Provable, not trust-me
✅ **User-owned** - Data in user's repo, not company database
✅ **Protocol, not platform** - Open standard for the ecosystem
✅ **Relationship intelligence** - Quantified trust, context, verification

**Moat:** Network effects + open protocol = **un-forkable advantage**
