## 🚀 High Priority Integrations

### 1. Real-Time Pipeline Architecture

**What it is**: Enterprise-scale streaming pipeline for relationship updates

**Source**: `apps/agent/src/services/real_time_pipeline.py`

**Why Protocol Needs It**:
- AT Protocol firehose delivers real-time events
- Need to process relationship changes as they happen
- Current system: Batch processing only
- FundRhiz solution: Event-driven pipeline with backpressure handling

**Features to Integrate**:
```python
class RealTimePipeline:
    - Event queuing with backpressure (1000+ concurrent)
    - Multi-stage processing (validation → enrichment → storage → indexing)
    - Rate limiting and retry logic
    - Performance metrics and monitoring
    - Worker pool management
    - Stream processing for relationships
```

**Protocol Use Cases**:
- Real-time relationship updates from firehose
- Live conviction score recalculation
- Streaming trust metric updates
- Event-driven attestation processing

**Estimated Work**: 6-8 hours
**Impact**: High - Enables real-time protocol features

### 2. Advanced Cache Service (Redis + Memory)

**What it is**: Production-ready caching with Redis/memory adapter

**Source**: `apps/agent/src/infrastructure/cache/cache_service.py`

**Why Protocol Needs It**:
- Current: Basic in-memory cache per service
- FundRhiz: Unified cache with Redis backend + memory fallback
- Needed for: Trust scores, conviction, graph paths, entity profiles

**Features to Integrate**:
```python
class CacheService:
    - Adapter pattern (memory/Redis)
    - TTL management
    - Pattern-based clearing
    - JSON serialization
    - Automatic fallback
    - Cache statistics
```

**Protocol Use Cases**:
- Cache trust metrics (24hr TTL)
- Cache graph paths (1hr TTL)
- Cache conviction scores (updated on attestation)
- Cache DID resolutions (7 day TTL)
- Cache entity profiles (6hr TTL)

**Configuration**:
```python
CACHE_BACKEND = "redis"  # or "memory"
CACHE_REDIS_URL = "redis://localhost:6379"
CACHE_DEFAULT_TTL = 3600  # 1 hour
```

**Estimated Work**: 4-5 hours
**Impact**: High - Massive performance improvement

### 3. Enrichment Orchestrator Pattern

**What it is**: Tiered fallback pattern for data enrichment

**Source**: `apps/agent/src/services/enrichment_orchestrator.py`

**Why Protocol Needs It**:
- Entities need enrichment beyond manual input
- FundRhiz pattern: Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 fallback with confidence scoring
- Generic pattern applicable to any entity enrichment

**Adapt for Protocol**:
```python
class EntityEnrichmentOrchestrator:
    """
    Tier 1: User-provided data (100% confidence)
    Tier 2: AT Protocol repo data (90% confidence)
    Tier 3: BAML extraction from bio/context (70% confidence)
    Tier 4: Manual review needed (<50% confidence)
    """
    
    async def enrich_entity(self, did: str) -> EnrichmentResult:
        # Try each tier with fallback
        # Track confidence scores
        # Cache results
        # Return merged data with sources
```

**Protocol Use Cases**:
- Entity profile enrichment
- Relationship context extraction
- Trust metric calculation from multiple sources
- Attestation validation

**Estimated Work**: 5-6 hours
**Impact**: Medium-High - Better data quality

    - forecast_network_growth()
```

**Protocol Use Cases**:

## 🚫 NOT Protocol-Relevant

These FundRhiz features are **application-specific** and should NOT be in the protocol:

### ❌ Stagehand + Browser Automation
- **Why**: Specific to scraping LinkedIn/Crunchbase for investors
- **Where**: Stays in FundRhiz application layer

### ❌ Exa AI Semantic Search
- **Why**: Specific to finding investors
- **Where**: Stays in FundRhiz application layer

### ❌ Investor/Pitch Services
- **Why**: Domain-specific to fundraising
- **Where**: Stays in FundRhiz application layer

### ❌ Forum/Agent Conversations
- **Why**: UI/UX feature for FundRhiz
- **Where**: Could be generic but not priority

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 1. Cache Backend
**Decision**: Redis for production, memory for development
**Rationale**: Redis provides distributed caching for multi-instance deployments

### 2. Real-Time Pipeline
**Decision**: asyncio-based, no heavy framework
**Rationale**: Lighter weight than Kafka, sufficient for protocol scale

### 3. Background Tasks
**Decision**: Celery or similar async task queue
**Rationale**: Standard Python solution, Redis-backed
