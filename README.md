# Rhiz Protocol - The Relationship Layer of the Internet

**AT Protocol Native | Federation-Ready | User-Owned Data**

Welcome! This repository contains the **Rhiz Protocol** - the first truly AT Protocol-native relationship intelligence system, built on Bluesky's AT Protocol infrastructure.

> **What is Rhiz?** A decentralized protocol for machine-readable trust, quantified relationships, and warm introductions. Built natively on AT Protocol from the ground up.

## üéØ What is Rhiz Protocol?

Rhiz Protocol makes **relationships machine-readable, verifiable, and portable**. It's the missing infrastructure layer for trust-weighted social graphs, warm introductions, and multi-agent coordination.

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Trust-Weighted Graphs** - Find paths between entities weighted by verified relationship strength
- ‚úÖ **Warm Introductions** - AI agents facilitate intros through optimal intermediaries
- ‚úÖ **Quantified Trust** - Transparent, verifiable trust scores (0-100 scale)
- ‚úÖ **DID-Native Identity** - AT Protocol DIDs as primary identifiers
- ‚úÖ **Content-Addressed** - All relationships stored as `at://` URIs with CIDs
- ‚úÖ **Federation-Ready** - User-owned data, multiple AppViews can index
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographically Signed** - All relationships require participant signatures

# Run dev environment (AT Protocol services)
make run-dev-env
```

## üåê Architecture

### AT Protocol Native Foundation

Rhiz is built **natively** on AT Protocol - not bolted on, but integrated from the ground up:

```
User AT Protocol Repo ‚Üí Firehose ‚Üí Rhiz AppView ‚Üí Applications
(Source of Truth)        (Sync)     (Index)        (FundRhiz, etc)
```

**Key Principles:**
- DIDs as primary identifiers (not arbitrary IDs)
- Relationships stored in user repos (`at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/*`)
- Content-addressed with AT URIs + CIDs
- Cryptographically signed by both participants
- Database indexes for fast queries, repos are source of truth

### Protocol Specifications

- **[Rhiz Lexicons](lexicons/net/rhiz/)** - 11 validated schemas defining `net.rhiz.*` collections
- **[Project Overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)** - Comprehensive protocol description
- **[Migration Guide](AT_PROTOCOL_NATIVE_MIGRATION.md)** - AT Protocol native architecture details
- **[AT Protocol Docs](https://atproto.com)** - Core AT Protocol specifications

### About AT Protocol

Rhiz Protocol is built on the Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("ATP" or "atproto"), a decentralized social media protocol developed by [Bluesky Social PBC](https://bsky.social).

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions that follow our architectural principles:

**Core Principles:**
- ‚úÖ Always upgrade, never degrade
- ‚úÖ No redundancies - single source of truth
- ‚úÖ AT Protocol native - use AT Protocol primitives
- ‚úÖ Federation-first - works in federated context
- ‚úÖ User ownership - data in repos, not databases

**Guidelines:**
- Open an issue for discussion before major PRs
- For lexicon changes, get sign-off before implementation
- Follow existing patterns (DID-native, content-addressed)
- Add tests and documentation
- Atomic commits with clear messages

## üèóÔ∏è Building on Rhiz Protocol

Developers can build applications using Rhiz Protocol's relationship intelligence:

```typescript
// Use the Rhiz SDK in your app
import { RhizClient } from '@atproto/rhiz-sdk';

const client = new RhizClient({ apiUrl: 'https://api.rhiz.network' });

// Access trust-weighted relationship graph
const paths = await client.graph.findPath({
  from: 'did:plc:user1',
  to: 'did:plc:user2'
});
```

**Use Cases:**
- Warm introduction platforms
- Trust-based content curation
- Community relationship mapping
- Professional network analysis
- Academic collaboration networks

## üåü Why Rhiz Protocol Matters

**Relationships are invisible infrastructure.** Social networks show connections, but don't understand trust, context, or strength. Rhiz makes relationships **machine-readable** and **verifiable**.

- **For Users:** Own your relationship data, portable across services
- **For Developers:** Build on proven relationship intelligence infrastructure
- **For The Ecosystem:** Missing protocol primitive that enables new applications

**Rhiz Protocol** - The relationship layer the internet never had.
