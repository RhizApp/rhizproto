# Rhiz Protocol - The Relationship Layer of the Web

**The Relationship Protocol for the Internet**

**Protocol Standard | AT Protocol Native | User-Owned Data**

Rhiz Protocol is a decentralized protocol for creating, verifying, and querying machine-readable relationships. Relationships are first-class data structures with quantified trust, temporal dynamics, and network verification.

> **What is Rhiz?** A protocol specification for verifiable relationships and trust, with a production-ready implementation on AT Protocol. Think OAuth for relationships, not just another social network.

## üéØ What is Rhiz Protocol?

Rhiz Protocol defines standard primitives for relationships, attestations, and trust - enabling any application to build on verifiable relationship data.

### Core Primitives

1. **Entity** - Any person, organization, or agent (identified by DID)
2. **Relationship** - Quantified connection between entities (strength 0-100)
3. **Attestation** - Third-party validation of relationships
4. **Trust Metrics** - Calculated scores based on network consensus

### Key Innovations

- ‚úÖ **Relationships as First-Class Data** - Not just graph edges, but rich data structures
- ‚úÖ **Network Verification** - Attestations create conviction scores (0-100)
- ‚úÖ **Trust Quantification** - Transparent algorithms, reproducible results
- ‚úÖ **Cryptographic Verification** - All relationships require signatures from participants
- ‚úÖ **User Ownership** - Data lives in user repositories, not centralized databases
- ‚úÖ **Federation-Ready** - Multiple services can index the same relationship data

## üåê Architecture

### AT Protocol Native Foundation

Rhiz is built **natively** on AT Protocol - not bolted on, but integrated from the ground up:

```
User AT Protocol Repo ‚Üí Firehose ‚Üí Rhiz AppView ‚Üí Applications
(Source of Truth)        (Sync)     (Index)        (FundRhiz, etc)
```

**Key Principles:**
- DIDs as primary identifiers (not arbitrary IDs)
- Relationships stored in user repos (`at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/*`)
- Content-addressed with AT URIs + CIDs
- Cryptographically signed by both participants
- Database indexes for fast queries, repos are source of truth

### Protocol Specifications

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions that follow our architectural principles:

**Core Principles:**
- ‚úÖ Always upgrade, never degrade
- ‚úÖ No redundancies - single source of truth
- ‚úÖ AT Protocol native - use AT Protocol primitives
- ‚úÖ Federation-first - works in federated context
- ‚úÖ User ownership - data in repos, not databases

**Guidelines:**
- Open an issue for discussion before major PRs
- For lexicon changes, get sign-off before implementation
- Follow existing patterns (DID-native, content-addressed)
- Add tests and documentation
- Atomic commits with clear messages

## üèóÔ∏è Building on Rhiz Protocol

Developers can build applications using Rhiz Protocol's relationship intelligence:

```typescript
// Use the Rhiz SDK in your app
import { RhizClient } from '@atproto/rhiz-sdk';

const client = new RhizClient({ apiUrl: 'https://api.rhiz.network' });

// Access trust-weighted relationship graph
const paths = await client.graph.findPath({
  from: 'did:plc:user1',
  to: 'did:plc:user2'
});
```

**Use Cases:**
- Warm introduction platforms
- Trust-based content curation
- Community relationship mapping
- Professional network analysis
- Academic collaboration networks

## üåü Why Rhiz Protocol Matters

**Relationships are invisible infrastructure.** Social networks show connections, but don't understand trust, context, or strength. Rhiz makes relationships **machine-readable** and **verifiable**.

- **For Users:** Own your relationship data, portable across services
- **For Developers:** Build on proven relationship intelligence infrastructure
- **For The Ecosystem:** Missing protocol primitive that enables new applications

**Rhiz Protocol** - The relationship layer the internet never had.
