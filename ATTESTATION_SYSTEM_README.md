# Attestation System: Complete Planning Package

**Welcome!** This document is your entry point to the complete Phase 2A implementation plan.

---

## üéØ What Is This?

Rhiz Protocol is integrating Intuition Protocol's conviction-based attestation system into our AT Protocol-native architecture. This transforms relationships from **"dual-signed"** to **"network-verified with conviction scores."**

**In Plain English:**
- Currently: Alice and Bob say they know each other (2 signatures)
- After Phase 2A: Alice and Bob say they know each other, AND 15 other people confirm it with 90% network confidence (network-verified)

**Timeline:** 8 weeks (October 22 - December 17, 2025)

## üéØ Key Concepts at a Glance

### Attestation
Third-party validation of a relationship or claim.

**Types:**
- **Verify** - "I confirm this relationship exists"
- **Dispute** - "I don't believe this is accurate"
- **Strengthen** - "The strength should be higher"
- **Weaken** - "The strength should be lower"

**Properties:**
- Confidence: 0-100 (how sure is the attester)
- Evidence: Optional text explanation
- Stored in: Attester's AT Protocol repo

### Conviction
Network confidence score (0-100) aggregated from all attestations.

**Calculation:**
1. Weight by type (verify +1.0, dispute -1.5, etc.)
2. Scale by attester reputation (0.5x to 2.0x)
3. Apply temporal decay (180-day half-life)
4. Scale by confidence (0-100)
5. Normalize to 0-100 score

**Result:**
- Score: 0 (low confidence) to 100 (high confidence)
- Trend: increasing, stable, decreasing
- Updated: Real-time via firehose

### Example Flow

```
1. Alice creates relationship with Bob
   URI: at://did:plc:alice/net.rhiz.relationship.record/abc123
   Initial conviction: 0 (no attestations)

2. Carol attests the relationship
   Creates: at://did:plc:carol/net.rhiz.relationship.attestation/xyz789
   Type: verify
   Confidence: 90%

3. Firehose indexes Carol's attestation
   Conviction updated: 0 ‚Üí 72

4. David also attests
   Type: verify
   Confidence: 95%
   Conviction updated: 72 ‚Üí 85

5. UI shows:
   "85% verified ‚Ä¢ 2 attestations ‚Ä¢ ‚Üí"
```
