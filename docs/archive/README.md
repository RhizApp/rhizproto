## Purpose of Archiving

These documents have been archived because:

1. **Completion** - The work described has been completed successfully
2. **Historical Record** - Maintains implementation history and decisions
3. **Reduce Clutter** - Keeps root directory focused on current and canonical docs
4. **Prevent Confusion** - Avoids outdated status causing confusion
